r"""Transform raw scraped card data into the output JSON format.

This module takes the card dicts produced by the scraper and enriches
them with art-style classification, pack points, promo volume grouping,
deck-builder numbers, special tags, and canonical image URLs. It
supports two output formats: ``v5`` (the full enriched schema) and
``v4`` (a reduced schema for backward compatibility).

def fetch_datamine_lookup():
    r"""fetch_datamine_lookup() -> dict

    Download the Flibustier PTCGP card database and build a lookup
    table mapping ``(set_code, card_number)`` tuples to deck-builder
    numbers.

    The set codes from the database are normalised to match the
    prefixes used in card IDs: promo codes like ``"promo-a"`` become
    ``"pa"``, and regular codes have hyphens stripped.

    The result is cached for the lifetime of the process, so a run
    that processes many sets downloads the database once.

    Returns:
        dict: keys are ``(str, int)`` tuples of (set prefix, card
        number). Values are deck-builder numbers (int).

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if the database cannot be downloaded, does not
            return HTTP 200, or parses to an empty lookup.

    .. note::

        This deliberately fails loudly. Returning an empty lookup
        would silently write ``deckBuilderNr: 0`` for every card in
        the run, which passes both the JSON schema and the test
        suite, so a transient network error would poison the dataset
        with no visible symptom.

    Convert a single v5 card dict into the v4 JSON format. Maps v5

    ``art_style`` is reduced to a ``"Yes"``/``"No"`` ``fullart`` flag,
    and ``hp`` is stringified.

    In particular :func:`downloader.download_images` reads
    ``source_url``, which :func:`_to_v4` does not carry over, so
    downgrading too early leaves the downloader with nothing to fetch.

    It is not part of the published schema, and ``cards.schema.json`` sets
    ``additionalProperties: false``, so it must be gone before validation.

    r"""transform_cards(raw_cards, set_profile, expansion_name, release_date=None) -> list of dict

    Transform raw scraped card dicts into the output format used by
    the API. Each card is enriched with:

    - Art style (Illustration Art, Full Art, Special Illustration
      Art, Immersive Art, Shiny, Shiny Full Art, Parallel Foil).
      Classification is inferred from rarity sequences and raw text
      duplication between consecutive cards.
    - Pack points from ``PACK_POINTS`` or ``SHINY_PACK_POINTS``
      depending on whether the card is shiny. Promo cards get None.
    - Promo pack volume grouping for ``P-A`` cards, using
      ``PROMO_CARDS_PER_VOLUME`` to split cards into numbered volumes.
    - Deck-builder numbers from the Flibustier datamine lookup.
    - Special tags (ancient, future, ultra beasts) matched against
      card names using compiled regex patterns.
    - Image URLs pointing to the GitHub raw content CDN, in both
      WebP and PNG formats.

    Args:
        raw_cards (list of dict): cards as returned by
            :func:`scrape_cards`, in card-number order, since the
            art-style classifier reads the sequence
        set_profile (SetProfile): the set the cards belong to
        expansion_name (str): human-readable expansion name
            (e.g. ``"Genetic Apex"``)
        release_date (str or None): release date in ``"YYYY-MM-DD"``
            format, included in each card's output. Default: ``None``

    Returns:
        list of dict: one transformed card dict per input card, each
        with about 30 keys spanning identity, classification,
        gameplay, deck-builder, and media fields.

    .. note::

        This function calls :func:`fetch_datamine_lookup` internally.
        That call is cached, so transforming several sets in one run
        downloads the datamine database once. If the download fails
        the lookup raises rather than returning empty, so a network
        error aborts the run instead of writing zeroed
        ``deckBuilderNr`` values.

    .. note::

        ``transform_cards(scrape_cards(SetProfile.of("a1")), SetProfile.of("a1"), "Genetic Apex")``
        gives a first card with ``id`` ``"a1-001"`` and ``name`` ``"Bulbasaur"``.
