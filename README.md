This open-source repository holds data on Pokémon TCG Pocket cards. You can use it to build websites, collection trackers, and fan tools.

You can pull the raw JSON directly as an API:

- Full dataset: **[data/v5/cards.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.json)** ([minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.min.json))
- Core payload: **[data/v5/cards.core.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.core.json)** ([minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.core.min.json))
- Gameplay payload: **[data/v5/cards.gameplay.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.gameplay.json)** ([minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.gameplay.min.json))
- Gameplay no-image payload: **[data/v5/cards.gameplay.no-image.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.gameplay.no-image.json)** ([minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.gameplay.no-image.min.json))
- Core no-image payload: **[data/v5/cards.core.no-image.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.core.no-image.json)** ([minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.core.no-image.min.json))
- Collection payload: **[data/v5/cards.collection.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.collection.json)** ([minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/cards.collection.min.json))
- Per-set shards: every payload is also split one file per set under `data/v5/<set>/`, linked from each **[expansions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/expansions.json)** entry via `cards_core_url`, `cards_gameplay_url`, `cards_collection_url` and their `no-image` and `_min` siblings.
- Expansions and packs: **[data/v5/expansions.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/expansions.json)** ([minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/refs/heads/main/data/v5/expansions.min.json))

Or install it from npm, which ships the minified data plus TypeScript definitions:

```bash
npm install pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards
```

import core from "pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/v5/core";
import gameplay from "pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/v5/gameplay";
import coreNoImage from "pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/v5/core/no-image";

// Full payload: every field, nested attacks and abilities.
console.log(cards[0].attacks);

// Core payload: gameplay rarities only, about 0.9 MB, suited to web clients.
console.log(core[0].deckBuilderNr);

// Gameplay payload: combat data for simulators, about 1.6 MB minified.

```

The pinned imports (`/v5`, `/v5/core`, `/v5/expansions`) keep their resolution when a future major version replaces the root import, so existing consumers can upgrade on their own schedule

### 📦 Moved files

Every dataset now lives under [data/](data/). If you link to a raw file at the repository root, update the URL:

| Old (removed)          | New                                                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/v1.json`             | [data/v1/cards.json](data/v1/cards.json) ([minified](data/v1/cards.min.json))   |
| `/v2.json`             | [data/v2/cards.json](data/v2/cards.json) ([minified](data/v2/cards.min.json))   |
| `/v3.json`             | [data/v3/cards.json](data/v3/cards.json) ([minified](data/v3/cards.min.json))   |
| `/v4.json`             | [data/v4/cards.json](data/v4/cards.json) ([minified](data/v4/cards.min.json))   |

## 📊 Schema comparison

The full per-payload field comparison lives in
[docs/payloads.md](docs/payloads.md#field-comparison-across-payloads). In
short, all v5 projections share the same card range (2,822 gameplay-rarity
cards); full and collection additionally keep all 3,879 printed cards.

| Payload | Minified size | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| core | 0.96 MB | Slim summary per gameplay card, webp image included |
| core no-image | 0.59 MB | Core with the image URL dropped |
| gameplay | 1.61 MB | Combat model: attacks, abilities, combat stats |
| gameplay no-image | 1.24 MB | Gameplay with the image URL dropped |
| collection | 2.99 MB | One record per printed card, trading fields derived |
| collection no-image | 1.98 MB | Collection with the image URL dropped |
| full | 4.77 MB | Everything the scraper extracts, all 3,879 cards |

### 💼 Support schedule

[💚 V5](data/v5/cards.json) is the actively maintained data model.
[💛 V4](data/v4/cards.min.json) receives updates until the end of the "B" block (its final expansion).
Versions [V3](data/v3/cards.json) and earlier are fully deprecated and no longer updated.

## ⚡ Adding a new expansion

When a new expansion drops, run the script to scrape card data, download card art, and update the JSON files.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 scripts/add_expansion.py <SET_CODE>
```

You can also scrape a chronological range of sets by linking them with an arrow.
```bash
python3 scripts/add_expansion.py a1->b4
```

The script handles these tasks:
1. Detects the expansion name and release date.
2. Scrapes all cards in the specified set or range.
3. Maps internal game asset IDs to `deckBuilderNr`.
4. Downloads [pack and card images](images/).
5. Appends new card records to the target **[JSON](data/v5/cards.json)** database.
6. Adds the expansion entry to the **[expansions](data/v5/expansions.json)** index.

### 🔄 Updating promo sets

Promo sets like P-A and P-B gain cards over time. Run the same command to pull new cards without duplicating existing ones:

```bash
python3 scripts/add_expansion.py PB
```

### ⚙️ Options

- Pass `--name "Custom Name"` to override the expansion name.
- Pass `--skip-images` to skip downloading images.
- Pass `--mode v4` to format the output for the legacy schema.
