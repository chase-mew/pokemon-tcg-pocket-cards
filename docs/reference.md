## V5 Schema

The **[V5](../data/v5/cards.min.json)** dataset is an array of card objects. Every card contains exactly 30 fields, always in this order.

| Field                | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| `art_style`          | string  | The visual treatment category. Null for cards with no special treatment, and for all `Crown Rare` cards (see below).                                             |
| `health`             | integer | The maximum hit points. Null for Trainers.                                                                                                                      |

`source_url` exists only in memory. The downloader fetches artwork from it, and the orchestrator calls `strip_source_urls` before validation, so it never reaches the published JSON. The schema sets `additionalProperties: false`, which enforces that.

### Known gaps

- **No `share_code`.** The reverse-engineered encoder lives in [deck_code.py](../scripts/deck_code.py) and is covered by tests, but it is not wired into the transformer, so no card carries a share code today. Only `deckBuilderNr` is published.
- **`Crown Rare` has no art style.** `ART_STYLES` has no crown category, so all Crown Rare cards carry `art_style: null`.


## V5 core schema

The **[core payload](../data/v5/cards.core.min.json)** is a slim projection of the V5 dataset for web clients: 14 fields per card, no nested objects, and only the gameplay rarities (diamonds and promos). Star rares and the Crown Rare are cosmetic duplicates that share a `deckBuilderNr` with a kept card, so they are dropped. The payload is about 0.9 MB against 4.6 MB for the full dataset. Import it from `pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/v5/core`. Field order matches the full schema

| Field           | Type            | Description                                                        |
|:----------------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | string          | Set prefix and padded card number (e.g., "a1-001").                |
| `name`          | string          | The printed name of the card.                                      |
| `set_code`      | string          | The normalised lowercase set code.                                 |
| `pack`          | string          | The named pack the card drops from.                                |
| `type`          | string          | "Pokémon" or "Trainer".                                            |
| `subtype`       | string          | Energy type for Pokémon. Item classification for Trainers.         |
| `stage`         | string, null    | Basic, Stage 1, or Stage 2. Null for Trainers.                     |
| `rarity`        | string          | The visual rarity indicator.                                       |
| `ex`            | boolean         | True if the card is an "ex" rulebox Pokémon.                       |
| `mega`          | boolean         | True if the card is a Mega Evolution.                              |
| `health`        | integer, null   | The maximum hit points. Null for Trainers.                         |
| `points`        | integer, null   | Points awarded to the opponent when knocked out. Null for Trainers.|
| `deckBuilderNr` | integer         | The internal integer used by the game client for deck rendering.   |
| `image`         | string          | URL to the WebP version of the card image.                         |

The **[no-image variant](../data/v5/cards.core.no-image.min.json)** drops `image` for the same 2,822 records, leaving 13 fields per card at about 0.6 MB minified. Import it from `pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/v5/core/no-image`. Field order matches the core schema minus `image`.

## V5 gameplay schema

The **[gameplay payload](../data/v5/cards.gameplay.min.json)** exists for battle simulators: it keeps the combat and card-effect fields a match needs and drops collection metadata, set and pack context beyond the set code, and all image URLs. It shares the core payload's rarity filter (diamonds and promos, 2,822 records) and is about 1.4 MB minified against 0.9 MB for the core payload and 4.4 MB for the full dataset. Rarity is not present, so each row drops to a single print per card rather than one per cosmetic variant. Import it from `pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards/v5/gameplay`. Field order is fixed and matches the full schema where the field appears.

| Field           | Type            | Description                                                       |

| `set_code`      | string          | The normalised lowercase set code.                                |
| `type`          | string          | "Pokémon" or "Trainer".                                           |
| `subtype`       | string          | Energy type for Pokémon. Item classification for Trainers.        |

| `ability`       | object          | Contains `exists` (boolean), `name` (string), and `effect` (string). |
| `attacks`       | object          | Contains keys `1` and `2`. Each holds `cost`, `name`, `damage` (integer), and `effect` (string). |
| `card_text`     | string, null    | The mechanical rules text for Trainer cards.                      |

## V4 Schema

The **[v4](../data/v4/cards.min.json)** schema is a legacy flat structure. It lacks arrays and objects.

| Field     | Type   | Description                                   |
|:----------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------|
| `id`      | string | Set prefix and padded card number.            |
| `name`    | string | The printed name of the card.                 |
| `rarity`  | string | The visual rarity indicator.                  |
| `pack`    | string | The specific pack the card drops from.        |
| `health`  | string | The maximum hit points. Empty string if none. |
| `image`   | string | URL to the PNG version of the card image.     |
| `fullart` | string | "Yes" or "No".                                |
| `ex`      | string | "Yes" or "No".                                |
| `artist`  | string | The credited illustrator.                     |
| `type`    | string | Energy type or Trainer classification.        |

## Command line arguments

The `add_expansion.py` script takes the following parameters:

| Argument        | Description                                                                                                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `set_code`      | (Required unless `--all`) The set identifier or range string (e.g., `a1->b4`, `a1`, `pb`)                          |
| `--all`         | (Optional) Scrapes every set listed on the Limitless index, oldest first. Cannot be combined with `--name`.        |
| `--name`        | (Optional) Forces a specific expansion name instead of auto-detecting it from the webpage title.                   |
| `--mode`        | (Optional) Sets the output format. Valid options are `v4` or `v5`. The default is `v5`.                            |
| `--skip-images` | (Optional) Disables the downloading of WebP and PNG image assets.                                                  |

## Test suite

The repository uses `pytest` to validate the JSON output. Run the test suite from the root directory.

```bash
pytest tests/
```

The tests cover:
- **Schema compliance:** ensures exact key order, strict null usage over empty strings, and valid data types.
- **Invariants:** verifies that sets are contiguous blocks, numbering has no gaps, and art styles follow the correct ordering (e.g., Full Arts precede Special Illustration Arts).
- **Cross-file consistency:** ensures every set in the JSON has a matching entry in the expansions file, and that pack names align exactly between the two files.
- **Image availability:** Checks that every scraped card has both a WebP and PNG file present in the local [images/](../images) folder.
- **Published artifacts:** validates `cards.json` and `expansions.json` against the committed JSON Schemas, checks every `.min.json` against its source, checks the generated `.d.ts` files for stale or optional fields, and checks that every `package.json` export resolves to a file on disk.
- **Pipeline units:** exercises the scraper's HTML parsing, the art-style state machine (including shiny detection after the Immersive block), the v4 downgrade, the merge and sort logic in `database.py`, the deck-code encoder, and the image downloader's URL allow-list, all without network access.
